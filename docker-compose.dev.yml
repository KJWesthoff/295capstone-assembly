# Development override - exposes frontend and nginx for dev workflow
# API calls go through nginx proxy for consistency with production
# Usage: docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

services:
  # Enable nginx in development for API routing
  nginx:
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    profiles: []  # Enable nginx in dev mode
  
  # Also expose frontend directly for faster development/debugging
  frontend:
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    environment:
      # Use nginx proxy for API calls (consistent with production)
      - REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost

  # Backend and Redis stay internal - no direct access needed
